### Build Google homepage using HTML and CSS

## Version 1
- Use basic HTML and CSS, no CSS Flexbox or Grid 

# Put main elements on the page:
Google logo, search bar, search icon, search by voice icon, Google Search and I'm Feeling Lucky buttons
Top navigation bar and footer

# Details on each element:
- Top navbar: unorderer list, each item is float to left or right and linked to a webpage
- Google logo: image, display block, align center, margin top 120px
- Search bar: form element, text type input
- Search icon: image, set as background image of search bar
- Search by voice icon: image, set as background image of search bar
- Google search and I'm Feeling Lucky buttons: button, align text center, cursor pointer, border showing on hover
- Footer: similar to topnavbar, unorderer list, each item is float to left or right and linked to a webpage except Settings

# Things to be worked on for version 2
- Top navbar: change text font, add Google apps and account images
- Search and by voice icons:
+ find better icons that look more like the original ones  
+ treat search by voice as a button to be hovered and clicked
+ apply Flexbox or Grid to corporate them with the search background
- I'm Feeling Lucky button: find a way to shuffle them for other phrases
- Footer: add click function for Settings, find out the right color for background, remove the white bar on the bottom of the page
